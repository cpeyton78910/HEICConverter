# HEICConverter

HEICConverter is a simple PowerShell Script to Automagically Convert HEIC Files to JPEG within the same folder as the file.

## Steps to Set Up

1. Download [Files](https://github.com/cpeyton78910/HEICConverter/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract its contents
2. Place `HEICConverter.ps1` into the folder you want monitored
   - Any HEIC files in the same folder as this file will automatically be converted to a JPEG
3. Right-click `HEICConverter.ps1` and select **Run with PowerShell**
4. If prompted, click **YES** to run as Administrator
5. After running once, the script will automatically launch on startupâ€”no need for manual execution.

**Important:** Do **NOT** rename `HEICConverter.ps1`, as this **WILL** cause issues.  
If the script was placed then executed from the wrong folder:
1. Run `RemoveHEICConverterFromStartup.bat`
2. If prompted, click **YES** to run as Administrator
3. Then repeat steps 3-5

## Handling OS Security with Files from the Internet
Your OS may block downloaded scripts from the Internet for security reasons. If that happens:
1. Right-click `HEICConverter.ps1`
2. Go to Properties
3. Look for an 'Unblock' checkbox, enable it, and click Apply. After that, you're ready for Step 3

## Steps to Uninstall

1. Run `RemoveHEICConverterFromStartup.bat`
2. If prompted, click **YES** to run as Administrator
3. Delete `HEICConverter.ps1` and `RemoveHEICConverterFromStartup.bat`
4. Navigate to `C:\Program Files`, locate any ImageMagick folders, and delete them
